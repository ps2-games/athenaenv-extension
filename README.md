# AthenaEnv Extension for VSCode

Allows trailing "f" character on decimal numbers in JavaScript (C#-style floats) when your workspace has an athena.ini file in the root. This way floats aren't marked as errors in VSCode and your theme will highlight them properly.

This is meant to be used with the [AthenaEnv](https://github.com/DanielSant0s/AthenaEnv) JavaScript environment used for making PlayStation 2 games.

## How to install
This isn't available on the VSCode Marketplace yet. You can either compile a .vsix file yourself or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/CarterTMDev/athenaenv-extension/releases) page and download the latest .vsix file.

Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) from Microsoft to install the extension. It should then be visible in your Extensions sidebar in VSCode.

Note that you won't receive automatic updates to this extension so check back here for new versions.
